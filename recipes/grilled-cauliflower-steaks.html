            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>These grilled cauliflower steaks are not just beautifully caramelized with a flavorful smoky taste, the presentation is lovely! A delicious change from boring old steamed cauliflower. I like my cauliflower a little on the firm side, so add a few extra minutes if you like it softer.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
                <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
                <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
                <li>2 large heads cauliflower</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons minced cilantro (Optional)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill to medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. </li>
                <li>Whisk oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt, smoked paprika, brown sugar, chili powder, and black pepper together in a bowl; set aside. </li>
                <li>Remove the tough bottom leaves from each cauliflower, taking care not to remove the stem. Place the cauliflower heads onto a cutting board with the stem side facing upwards; cut vertically on both sides of the stem to remove the loose florets. Cut each cauliflower vertically through the stem into 2 even "steaks", 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick; remove any remaining small leaves from each steak. Place cauliflower steaks on a baking sheet. </li>
                <li>Brush one side of each steak with some of the oil mixture. Place steaks on the preheated grill, oiled-side down; grill for 5 minutes. Brush more oil mixture on top of steaks and gently flip over; grill until golden brown and slightly charred, 5 to 7 minutes more. Drizzle with any remaining oil and remove to a plate. Sprinkle with cilantro. </li>
            </ol>
